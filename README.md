# Pokemon Gallaecia Web Backend
The REST Api of the Pok√©mon Gallaecia Game

## Welcome!
Hello everyone. Here you'll find the source code of the `REST Api` that supports all online game functionalities, like live weather,
real time checking, game data persistence, leaderboards, community support...

## Work in progress
Currently we are on a very preliminar version, actually still designing and redesigning the correct relation between all data involved with the game.
Our attention now it's highly focused on end the game source code, but still need the REST Api working to complete the first stable version on the game, so we are here too!

## Contrib
Some vulnerable parts of the source code ae, obviousl, ommited. You can colaborate with the project in two main ways:
- Make a `pull request`, related with a previously opened issue.
- Contact us on **zerodaycode@tutanota.com**, suggesting any aspect you wanna discuss or want to work with.
